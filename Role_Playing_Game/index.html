            Welcome to Dragon Repeller.
            You must defeat the dragon that is preventing people from leaving the town.
            You are in the town square. Where do you want to go? Use the buttons above.

    <!-- give your now empty script element a src attribute set to ./script.js. -->
    <script src="./script.js"></script>
</body>

<!--
JavaScript interacts with the HTML using the Document Object Model, or DOM.
The DOM is a tree of objects that represents the HTML.
You can access the HTML using the document object, which represents your entire HTML document.

One method for finding specific elements in your HTML is using the querySelector() method.
The querySelector() method takes a CSS selector as an argument and returns the first element
that matches that selector. For example, to find the <h1> element in your HTML, you would write:
let h1 = document.querySelector("h1");

Remember that CSS id selectors are prefixed with a #.
let button1 = document.querySelector("#button1");

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have run into a slight problem. You are trying to query your page for a button element,
but your script tag is in the head of your HTML.
This means your code runs before the browser has finished reading the HTML,
and your document.querySelector() will not see the button -
because the browser hasn't processed it yet.

To fix this, move your script element out of the head element, and place it at the end of
your body element (just before the closing </body> tag.)
